# movies_buff

A new Flutter project. Uses ListView for showing Movies fetching from the Sqlite Database. Lists are depecated in Flutter now. Also added Form fuctionality to add/delete update movie. Also along with that a page that contains Movie Poster, Movie Name, and Director Name. We can also view Watched Movies. The movie ListTile we click gets added to Watched Movies List.

Edit: The video link provided in the Google Form has permission issues. The below link will be feasible to view the video demonstration. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
